ChatApp using meteor. 
To run the app, install meteor (https://www.meteor.com/install), and go through basic tutorial. Open command prompt, go the project directory and type in meteor. User able to delete messages. Data following sequential consistency.
I am using Publish and subscribe to read data and meteor methods to write data. Github login enabled but chat not working with that. Still working on that, and UI.
Help from you guys always appreciated. If you have a suggestion or anything, feel free to write me at naman.gupta08@gmail.com
